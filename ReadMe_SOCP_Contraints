All the code is relevant to convex optimization for learning and visualization.

%% This code is for visualizing Second Order Cone Constraints of the following form
%|| Ax + b|| < c'x + d   # c' = traspose(c)  # ||.|| is norm 2
% In my example I have taken A as 2x2 matrix defining two hyperplanes
% 1st hyperplane => x+y-1
% 2nd hyperplane => x-y-1
% c'x + d => x+1
